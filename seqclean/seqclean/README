0.Introduction
==============
SeqClean is a tool for validation and trimming of DNA sequences from a flat 
file database (FASTA format). SeqClean was designed primarily for "cleaning"
of EST databases, when specific vector and splice site data are not 
available, or when screening for various contaminating sequences is desired.
The program works by processing the input sequence file and filtering its 
content according to a few criteria: 
  * percentage of undetermined bases
  * polyA tail removal 
  * overall low complexity analysis
  * short terminal matches with various sequences used 
    during the sequencing process (vectors, adapters)
  * strong matches with other contaminants or unwanted sequences
    (mitochondrial, ribosomal, bacterial, other species than the 
    target organism etc.)
    
The user is expected to provide the contaminant databases, 
they are not included in this package.

1.Requirements
==============
 * perl version >= 5.6
 * a working installation of recent versions of NCBI's 
   blastall and megablast programs (
 * one or more databases of potential contaminants (e.g. a vector 
   database like NCBI's UniVec) properly formatted to work with 
   NCBI's blastall (using formatdb)

A binary distribution for this package is provided for Linux ix86 systems
with glibc >=2.1.  NCBI's blastall and megablast are not included, 
they should instead be obtained directly from NCBI.
The source code of the various other tools included in the package 
is provided so they can be compiled on other Unix platforms 
where NCBI's tools work. 

2.Installation
==============
Create a directory where you plan the package to reside. 
Copy the compiled archive into that directory and unpack the archive 
in there:

tar xvfz seqclean.tar.gz

This will unpack a few files in the current directory
and will create a bin subdirectory with several files. 
The program to run is seqclean script from the main directory.
When launched, this program will prefix the local ./bin 
subdirectory to the shell's path. Optionally, you may move/copy 
all binaries and scripts from ./bin subdirectory somewhere 
in your working shell PATH. You can also copy the main script
(seqclean) to your preferred script location (which should be in the 
shell's PATH), in which case the module Mailer.pm should go in the 
same directory with the tgicl script or into a one of the PERLLIB 
(%INC) directories.

There are 2 perl scripts in this package:

seqclean
bin/seqclean.psx

3.Usage and methods
===================
A short usage message is displayed when seqclean script is launched without
any parameters.

The seqclean script takes an input sequence file (fasta formatted) as the only 
required parameter:

seqclean your_est_file

seqclean creates two output files of interest: 
 1. the filtered FASTA file (your_est_file.clean for the example above) 
    containing only valid (non-trashed) and trimmed ("clear range") sequences
 2. a "cleaning report" (your_est_file.cln) providing details about 
   sequence trimming and trashing (coordinates, reasons for trashing, 
   contaminant names etc. - see below for a detailed description).

However, the simple usage example above will not perform any searches 
against contaminant databases (as there are none specified) but it will 
only provide basic analysis, removing the polyA/polyT tail, possibly 
clipping low-quality ends (the ends rich in undetermined bases) 
and trashing the ones which are too short (shorter than 100 or 
the -l parameter value) or which appear to be mostly low-complexity
sequence.

As suggested in the "Introduction", the contaminant databases provided 
by the user can be considered to be of two types:
  1. vector/adapter databases, which can determine the trimming 
    of the analyzed sequences even when only very short terminal matches 
    (down to 12 base pairs) are found. These database files should 
    be provided with the -v option (vector detection)
  2. extensive contaminants databases: the alignments between these 
    contaminants and the analyzed sequences are only considered if 
    they are longer than 60 base pairs with at least 94% identity; these 
    are provided with the -s option (screening for contamination)

In both cases the analyzed sequences will be searched against the provided 
files and the overlaps are analyzed. The contaminant databases should be 
all formatted as required for blastall (using NCBI's formatdb program).

In the first case (vector/linker scan), the overlaps are only considered 
if they are above 92% identity, they have very short gaps and they are 
located in the 30% distance from either end. Also, the shorter these 
overlaps are, the closer to either end of the analyzed sequence they 
should be, in order to be considered for trimming of the target sequence. 
Multiple vector/adapter databases can be provided at the -v option, separated 
by comma (do not use spaces around the comma). Example:

seqclean your_est_file -v /usr/db/UniVec,/usr/db/adaptors,/usr/db/linkers

In this example three database files are checked for short terminal 
matches with the analyzed sequences from "your_est_file".

The -s option case 2. above) works in a similar way, as more than one file can
be provided, but in that case only larger, statistically more significant 
hits are considered. Example:

seqclean your_est_file -v /usr/db/UniVec,/usr/db/linkers \
 -s /usr/db/ecoli_genome,/usr/db/mito_ribo_seqs

In both cases, the contaminant database files should be provided with 
their full path unless they can be found in the current working directory.
The searches against "-v" files are performed using blastall (blastn) with 
low stringency, while for "-s" provided files, megablast is used, for 
very fast screening. By default, the "smart" low-complexity filter is used 
during both type of searches (the -F "m D" option of blastall/megablast).
However, in some cases, short vector/adaptor terminal overlaps might 
be expected in regions of low-complexity, so the dust filter can be 
disabled completely for any database file given at the "-v" option, 
by appending the "^" character at the end of the file name:

seqclean your_est_file -v /usr/db/adapters^,/usr/db/UniVec,/usr/db/linkers^ \
 -s /usr/db/ecoli_genome,/usr/db/mito_ribo_seqs

In the example above, the "dust" filter is totally disabled for blastn 
searches against /usr/db/adapters and /usr/db/linkers, while for the 
other files (/usr/db/UniVec) it will still be set to work in "smart" 
mode as mentioned above.

The cleaning scripts keep track of iterative trimming of the input 
sequences through multiple matches with various contaminants, 
if that's the case.The 5' end (end5) coordinate of each input sequence 
is initially set to 1, and the 3' end (end3) coordinate is considered 
to be the length of the initial sequences. During the above mentioned 
trimming procedures, end5 can be increased and/or end3 can be decreased.
The final end3-end5+1 range is considered to be the "clear range" of the 
sequence after going through the cleaning procedure. No matter if trimming 
was applied or not, if the "clear range" length is shorter than a minimum
value (default 100nt, can be set by -l option), the sequence will 
be considered invalid and it will be trashed. Also, at the end of 
the cleaning procedure, the percentage of undetermined bases from the 
clear range is computed and the sequence is also trashed if this 
percentage is larger than 3%.

Cleaning report format
----------------------
Each line in the cleaning report file (*.cln) has 7 tab-delimited fields 
as follows:

1. the name of the input sequence
2. the percentage of undetermined bases in the clear range 
3. 5' coordinate after cleaning
4. 3' coordinate after cleaning
5. initial length of the sequence
6. trash code
7. trimming comments (contaminant names, reasons for trimming/trashing)

The trash code field (6) should be empty if (part of) a sequence is 
considered valid - so it can be found in the final filtered file (*.clean)

The trash code field will be set to the file name of the last contaminant 
database, if that determined the clear range to fall below the minimum value 
(-l parameter, default 100). There are three reserved values of 
the trash code:

  "shortq" - assigned when the sequence length decreases 
             below the minimum accepted length (-l) after polyA            
             or low quality ends trimming;
"low_qual" - assigned when the percentage of undetermined bases
             is greater than 3% in the clear range;
    "dust" - assigned when less than 40nt of the sequence 
             is left unmasked by the "dust" low-complexity filter;


The reasons and the coordinates for trimming are mentioned in the 7th
field. When trimming was due to a contaminant match, the contaminant 
name and the overlap coordinates are mentioned. When trimming was due 
to polyA tail or low quality ends removal, the "trimpoly" program name is 
mentioned along with the trimming coordinates.

Besides the -s and -v parameters mentioned above, here is a brief summary
of the other parameters:

-c  : enables parallel processing by specifying the number of local CPUs 
      to use (for a SMP machine) or a filename containing a list of PVM node 
      names (one host name per line, per CPU). In the PVM case, if a node 
      is also a SMP machine and you want to use more than one CPU on that 
      node, you should list that same node name as many times as many CPUs 
      you want to use on that node. If this option is not provided, 
      only one CPU is used on the local machine.
-n  : the input file is not usually processed as one single query file. 
      Instead, it is sliced up into little parts and each part 
      is processed separately; this option is useful to tweak when 
      you also make use of the multi-CPU option (-c), as each slice can 
      be processed by one CPU.
-l  : the minimum accepted length of the clear range in order 
      to be considered valid. If the length of the clear range falls
      below this value, a trash code is assigned to the input sequence 
      and it will be exclued from the output filtered file (*.clean)
-r  : custom name of the cleaning report file (default: add the ".cln"
      suffix to the input file name)
-o  : custom name of the final "clear range"-only FASTA file containing only 
      the valid sequences (default: append ".clean" suffix to the 
      input file name)
-x  : set the minimum percent identity to be considered for an 
      alignment with a contaminant (default 96)
-y  : minimum length of a terminal vector hit to be considered
      (>11, default 11)           
-N  : disable any attempt of trimming of low quality ends (ends rich in 
      N = undetermined bases)
-M  : completely disable trashing of low quality (N-rich) sequences     
-A  : disable trimming of polyA tails from 3' end or polyT from 5' end of
      the input sequences
-L  : disable low-complexity analysis and the trashing of input sequences 
      by this criterion
-I  : do not rebuild the .cidx file (if already there)



If after seqclean one needs to trim the corresponding quality values too, 
according to the new coordinates or trash codes found by seqclean, the 
utility script "cln2qual" is included (see the usage message). It expects 
a fasta-like file containing space delimited quality values for each nucleotide of 
the original sequences. It should be run after the seqclean, as it parses the 
trimming ("clear range") coordinates and trash codes from the cleaning report 
and applies them to the quality records.
